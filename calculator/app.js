/*Here's your calculator JavaScript file, where client-side logic happens.
 * Why not write the entire calculator in JavaScript? Mostly to give you experience with PHP ;D
 * but you totally could do it all client-side if you wanted to. */

//So, first you'll want to bind button handlers: 
$(document).ready(function(){
	//Everything in this block runs as soon the page is "ready" (ie, finished loading)
	$(".calculator-button").click(function(){
		//do something when a button is clicked
	});
});
