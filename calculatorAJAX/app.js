//So, first you'll want to bind button handlers: 
$(document).ready(function(){
	//Everything in this block runs as soon the page is "ready" (ie, finished loading)
	$(".calculator-button").click(function(){
		//do something when a button is clicked
	});
});

//Have fun with the asynchronous stuff, callback functions, etc.
//These are pretty high-level concepts. Hit me up if you need help.
